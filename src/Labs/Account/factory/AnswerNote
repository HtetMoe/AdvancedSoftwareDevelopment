The Factory pattern solves the problem by:

=> Easy Environment Switching: Change environments (test vs. production)
   without modifying service classes.
=> Centralized Creation: Manages object creation in one place,
   simplifying maintenance.
=> Extensible: Add new DAO types without changing existing code, enhancing flexibility,
   adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.
