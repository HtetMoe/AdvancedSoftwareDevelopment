Explanation:

	•	State Interface: Defines a common interface for different states.
	•	Concrete States: Implement the State interface with specific behavior.
	•	Context Class: Maintains a reference to a State object and delegates requests to it.
	•	Client Code: Creates a Context object, sets its state, and makes requests to demonstrate
	    changing behavior based on the current state.

purpose
 - enables an object to alter its behavior when its state changes, avoiding complex conditionals.

 Real-world Analogy:

   A traffic light changes its behavior based on its current light (red, yellow, green),
   adapting actions according to the state.
