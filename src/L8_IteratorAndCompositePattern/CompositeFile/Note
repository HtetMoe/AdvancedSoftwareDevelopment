Explanation:

	1.	FileComponent is the base interface for all components (files and folders).
	2.	File is a leaf that implements the base component.
	3.	Folder is a composite that can hold multiple components (both files and other folders).
	4.	The client interacts with both File and Folder uniformly via the FileComponent interface,
	    demonstrating the recursive structure of the pattern.
