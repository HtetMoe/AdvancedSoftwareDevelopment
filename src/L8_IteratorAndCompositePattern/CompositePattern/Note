Composite Pattern Components:

	1.	Component: Common interface for all objects in the composition (both individual and
	    composite objects). This can include methods like add(), remove(), and display().
	2.	Leaf: Implements the Component interface. Represents individual objects in
	    the composition.
	3.	Composite: Implements the Component interface and stores child components
	    (both Leaf and other Composite objects).
	4.	Client: Uses the Component interface to interact with objects in the composition,
	    treating both individual objects (leaves) and groups of objects (composites) uniformly.
