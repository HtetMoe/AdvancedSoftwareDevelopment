Summary:

	•	Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
	    without exposing the underlying representation.

	•	Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
	    hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects
	    uniformly.
