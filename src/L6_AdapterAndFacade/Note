Summary:
	•	Adapter Pattern: Used to bridge two incompatible interfaces
	    (e.g., converting VGA to HDMI).
	•	Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
	    (e.g., starting a computer system).

Both patterns help in making the system easier to work with by hiding complexity or
adapting interfaces.

Summary:
	•	Object Adapter uses composition, is more flexible, and can adapt multiple classes.
	•	Class Adapter uses inheritance and is limited to a single class.
