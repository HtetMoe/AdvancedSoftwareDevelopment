The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
It makes a system easier to use by hiding the complexity behind a simple interface.

Components:
	1.	Subsystem Classes: These are the classes that perform the complex operations.
	2.	Facade: The simplified interface that interacts with the subsystem classes and
	    hides their complexity.
	3.	Client: The entity that uses the facade to interact with the subsystems.
