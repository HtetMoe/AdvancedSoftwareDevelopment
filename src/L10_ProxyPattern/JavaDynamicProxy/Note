Explanation:

	•	Proxy Creation: Proxy.newProxyInstance() generates a proxy object at runtime.
	•	Invocation Handler: ServiceInvocationHandler adds behavior before and after invoking the actual method on RealService.
	•	Dynamic Behavior: The proxy object intercepts method calls and provides additional logic dynamically.
