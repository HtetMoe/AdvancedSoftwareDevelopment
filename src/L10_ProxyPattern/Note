=> commonly used for access control, lazy initialization, or logging.

Explanation:

	•	Subject Interface (Image): Defines the interface both the real object and proxy must implement.
	•	RealSubject (RealImage): The actual object that performs the operation (e.g., loading and
	    displaying the image).
	•	Proxy (ProxyImage): Acts as a surrogate to the RealImage, handling the lazy loading of the
	    image when necessary.
	•	Client: Uses the ProxyImage to access the RealImage. The proxy controls when the real object
	    is loaded and displayed.


Purpose:
	•	Lazy Initialization: The RealImage is loaded only when it’s actually needed, not at the creation
	    of the proxy.

	    proxy = a person holding authority to act for another
	    eg.  a written paper giving a person such authority
