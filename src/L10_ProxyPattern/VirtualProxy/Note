=> commonly used for access control, lazy initialization, or logging.

Explanation:

	•	RealImage  : The actual object that is expensive to create (e.g., loading from disk).
	•	ProxyImage : The proxy that controls access to the real object,
	    only loading it when needed (lazy loading).
	•	Client     : interacts with Image through the proxy, which provides the same interface as
	    the real object.


Purpose:
	•	Lazy Initialization: The RealImage is loaded only when it’s actually needed, not at the creation
	    of the proxy.

	    proxy = a person holding authority to act for another
	    eg.  a written paper giving a person such authority
