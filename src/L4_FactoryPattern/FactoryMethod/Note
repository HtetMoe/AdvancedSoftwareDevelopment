Step-by-Step:

1. Define an Animal interface with a speak() method.
2. Implement Animal in Dog and Cat classes.
3. Define an abstract AnimalFactory with an abstract createAnimal() method and
   a concrete describeAnimal() method that uses the product.
4. Create DogFactory and CatFactory that extend AnimalFactory and implement createAnimal().
5. Use the factories in the client code to create and describe animals.

Pros:
	•	Flexibility to add new products without modifying the existing factory.
Cons:
	•	More complex due to the need for inheritance.

Steps:
	•	Create an abstract product.
	•	Create concrete products.
	•	Define an abstract factory class that contains the factory method.
	•	Subclasses of the factory decide which object to create.
