How the Factory Method Pattern Works Here:
=> Abstract Creator (PizzaStore): Defines the factory method createPizza()
that is used by the orderPizza() method.

=> Concrete Creators (NYStylePizzaStore, ChicagoStylePizzaStore):
 Implement the factory method to create specific types of pizzas.

=> Products (Pizza and its subclasses):
 Represent different types of pizzas that can be created.

=> Client Code: Uses the PizzaStore subclasses to order pizzas,
 without needing to know the exact pizza creation logic.
