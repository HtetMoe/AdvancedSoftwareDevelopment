Product => Car
Concrete Products => Tesla, Toyota

1. Define a Car interface with a method drive().
2. Implement Car in BMW and Tesla classes.
3. Create CarFactory with a static createCar() method that returns a Car based on input.
4. In the client code, use CarFactory to create and use different car objects.

Steps:
	•	Define a factory class with a method that returns objects.
	•	Use conditional logic to create different objects.

Pros:
	•	Centralized object creation.
Cons:
	•	Uses conditionals or switch statements, which can make it harder to extend.
