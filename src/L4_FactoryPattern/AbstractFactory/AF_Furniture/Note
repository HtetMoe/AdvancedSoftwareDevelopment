Pros:
	•	Can easily switch product families by changing the factory.
	•	Keeps product families consistent.

Cons:
	•	More complexity due to the multiple abstract products and factories.

	Steps:
    	•	Define an abstract product for each product family.
    	•	Define concrete product classes for each family.
    	•	Create an abstract factory with methods for creating each type of product.
    	•	Implement concrete factories for different families.
