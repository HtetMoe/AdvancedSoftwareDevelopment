 Components of the Observer Pattern:
        1. Observer Interface: Define the interface for observers, typically with an update() method.
        2. Concrete Observer Classes: Implement the Observer interface to define how each observer
           responds to updates.
        3. Subject Interface: Define the subject interface with methods to register, remove, and notify observers.
        4. Concrete Subject Class: Implement the subject interface to maintain a list of observers and
           notify them when its state changes.
        5. Client: Create the subject and observers, register them, and trigger updates by changing the subjectâ€™s state.
