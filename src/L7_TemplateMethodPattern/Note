Summary:
	•	The Template Method is defined in the base class (Game).
	•	Subclasses (Chess, Football) implement specific steps of the algorithm.

Purpose
=> This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

Components:
	1.	Template (Abstract Class): Defines the skeleton of the algorithm with the template method.
	2.	Concrete Classes: Implement the abstract steps of the algorithm.
	3.	Template Method: Provides the fixed algorithm structure while allowing subclasses to implement the steps.

	final to template method
	- this mean that subclasses cannot override this method.

	protected method ( for step methods)
	- This allows subclasses to override these methods
	  while preventing access to them by other classes.
