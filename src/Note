Context Class - use the strategy to perform actions.

1) What's strategy pattern?
=> define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one in a separate class,
 and make them interchangeable at runtime, enabling flexible and dynamic selection of the algorithm to use.

----------------------------
 2) What's observer pattern?
 => The Observer Pattern is a design pattern where an object (subject) notifies
  a list of dependent objects (observers) of any changes to its state,
  allowing the observers to react automatically.

  This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event handling systems.

 => Subject: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes.
 => Observer: Defines an update() method, which gets called when the subject changes.
 => ConcreteObserver: Implements the Observer interface and reacts to updates from the subject.
